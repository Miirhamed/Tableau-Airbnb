# Tableau-Airbnb
Visualization of Airbnb Barcelona locations in 2022 and 2023.
This can give an understanding of the most expensive areas and highest demands in Barcelona according to data of Airbnb

1. Get the data: the source of data is available on 
    http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
    For this visualization we used 2 files. listings.csv and calendar.csv
2. After cleaning data and connecting tables according to the primary key in the Tableau, I prepared 5 sheets in the dashboard. 
    1. Barchart of average price per bedroom. 
    2. Number of posted properties based on number of bedrooms they have.
    3. Map of Barcelona Neighbourhoods with average prices.
    4. Bar Chart of average price in each neighbourhood
    5. Line chart timetable of revenue
